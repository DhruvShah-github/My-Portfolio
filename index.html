    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="about-box">
      <p>
        I'm a curious and hands-on learner with a passion for building things that blend creativity and technology. Whether I'm designing in CAD, programming a new tool, machining parts for a project, or experimenting with electronics, I enjoy diving deep and figuring things out. I’m always eager to learn something new and take on challenges that push me to grow. Currently, I’m studying Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo, where I continue to develop my skills and expand my knowledge.

      <h3>Smart Parking System</h3>
      <p>I designed an efficient parking system for commercial lots using STM32 Nucleo boards with the goal of helping drivers save time and reduce frustration during peak hours. The system guides users through entry and exit while showing real-time parking availability via seven-segment displays. Using UART communication between microcontrollers helps reduce congestion and minimize carbon emissions, contributing to a smoother, more sustainable urban experience.</p>

      <h3>Student Grading Software</h3>
      <p>Created a Python-based desktop application to help teachers manage and update student grades more efficiently. My goal was to simplify their workflow and reduce the time spent on administrative tasks. Using a Tkinter interface, the software allows for easy editing of grades and visualizes student progress, making grading not only faster but also more organized.</p>

      <h3>Brass Chess Pieces</h3>
      <p>Inspired by the idea of blending engineering precision with craftsmanship, this project involved designing and fabricating brass king and pawn chess pieces. After modeling them in Onshape, I used a manual metal lathe and vertical mill to bring the designs to life. The process demanded careful attention to detail in order to achieve clean, symmetrical results that were both functional and refined.</p>

      <h3>Wooden Clock</h3>
      <p>For this project, my goal was to manufacture a fully functional wooden clock while gaining hands-on experience with digital fabrication and precision design. The clock was modeled in VCarve and fabricated using a laser cutter, applying techniques such as cutting, engraving, and scoring. This hands-on experience strengthened my manufacturing skills while resulting in a piece that’s both functional and visually appealing.</p>

      <h3>Rings</h3>
      <p>Manufactured two rings using a manual metal lathe, followed by polishing for a clean, elegant finish. This process allowed me to refine my precision and control when working with metal.</p>

      <h3>Keychain</h3>
      <p>My first manufacturing project, a custom keychain, was designed in VCarve and manufactured using a CNC milling machine, a vertical band saw, and a drill press. This experience was a great start, allowing me to develop essential skills in machining.</p>
